My name is Franklin Ndubuisi. This is Operating system Lab Assignment 4. This is a modification to my prime program.This program now implements a Client-Server kind of relationship. The server listens for client requests through a named pipe (FIFO) and calculates prime numbers within a specified range. It verifies client input, checks for prime numbers, and sends the result back through the pipe. It was completed using ubuntu. To enjoy the use this program follow the instructions as directed by the code and you should be good to go.
